# System Overview

- Project Abstract<br/>
    “SOKROBAN” is a game that will allow the user to solve challenging puzzles by pushing crates and placing them into a specific place inside a room when selecting the “Single Player” mode or challenge friends and people online when selecting the “Multiplayer” mode.

- Conceptual Design<br/>
    “SOKROBAN” will be done in Unity editor using C# coding language. The database will be built using SQL, and the Multiplayer will be created by using the Photon Engine. 


- Background <br/>
    “SOKROBAN” will be an updated version, with added features, of the original game called “Sokoban” which was originally published in December 1982. There are also a lot of different projects built by different users online that identically copy the game, however, from my research, none of them offers a multiplayer option or a harder version of the game such as “SOKROBAN” will do. Finally, the game will be built from scratch without using any open-source product or any other existing source code.
