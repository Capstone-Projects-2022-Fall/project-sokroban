# Version Control
- GitHub will be utilized as the version control system for Sokroban

- The master branch will be protected. 
    - No developer can commit changes directly to the master branch.
    - All changes made on other branch will require another developers review/ok before being merged into the master branch.

- Each additional feature of the application will be given its own branch and will be manipulated using Jiras built in GitHub functionallity.

- All code changes will be pushed into a SPRINT_1 branch where developers can tested a “Completed” version of Sokroban before all the code is pushed into the master branch.
